The CSV files contain survey data where individuals were asked to rank the top three teams from the NHL, NFL, MLB, and MLH</br>
Program reads the survey data to create a consolidated "Survey Database" file of the aforementioned CSV files</br>
If the files are invalid (missing cells), they will not be added to "Survey Database" and will be added to an "Error Log" text file</br>
